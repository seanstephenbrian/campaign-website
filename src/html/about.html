<h2>Leader</h2>

<p>
    When John sees a need he steps in.  He likes to put ideas into action—taking 
    conceptual ideas and transforming them into concrete steps. Being results driven 
    provides a way to ensure benefits reach everyone equally. Motivated by more than 
    just the results, but how they impact the people involved.

<h2>Experience</h2>

<p>
    John’s love for youth sports motivated him to become the Commissioner of AYSO Evanston 
    during the COVID pandemic.  Through his leadership, soccer returned to the fields of 
    Evanston after a one-year absence, and efficiencies were gained which led to a reduction 
    in participation fees paid by families. And most importantly, the kids had fun.
