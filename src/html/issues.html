        <ul class="issues-list">
            <li>
                Returning rigorous academics as a top priority for D65
            </li>
            <li>
                A belief that lowering college preparedness standards is not equity or a strategy for success
            </li>
            <li>
                Aligning D65 curriculum with D202 so that students are fully prepared for high school and beyond; the 
                current system provides false encouragement to students
            </li>
            <li>
                The millions of dollars spent on consultants and administrators take funds away from academics 
                and teachers' focus away from teaching
            </li>
            <li>
                Equity and excellence are not mutually exclusive
            </li>
            <li>
                Diverting focus from academics has resulted in inequity among disadvantaged students
            </li>
            <li>
                D65 should restore advanced math path for its students, including geometry

                <li>
                    It’s tragic that it’s gone — it helped countless D65 students over many years

                <li>
                    Not providing it promotes inequity and is harmful most to disadvantaged students, 
                    setting them further behind when moving on to university

        District 65 must foster a better relationship with the teachers and parents. School leaders should treat
        everyone with respect and must work collaboratively with others, even when opinions differ.

                Teacher exodus and student exodus leading to a 15% decline in enrollment hurts public schools;
